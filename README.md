# Graphs of Functions
Educational project for web and math enthusiasts.

The simple app showcases line graphs for mathematical equations where the y-value is dependent on the x-value. In example: y = 2x, y = sin(x), and y = x^2.

Crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For each equation, x denotes a range of numbers, and y values are generated based on the equation's logic. These pairs of x and y values serve as coordinates for individual points, forming a continuous line when connected.

While the graph is generated using (3x3)px points, it's important to note that the line may contain small gaps due to the limited resolution. To mitigate this, x and y values have been appropriately divided by specific numbers to ensure points remain closely connected; still not so accurate yet.

This project is designed to foster a deeper understanding of both web development principles and mathematical concepts, making it an ideal resource for enthusiasts and learners alike.
